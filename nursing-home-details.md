## GOAL: Uncover contractor utilization trends in U.S. nursing homes to optimize sales strategies.

## Actions Taken:

**Merged two large datasets:**
1,048,575 rows of daily staffing data from Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ).
14,512 rows of nursing home provider data.

**Calculated** contractor utilization percentages for each nursing home, identifying the top 10 facilities with the highest contractor reliance.

**Performed** geographic analysis to highlight states with the highest contractor utilization, including Maine, New York, and Delaware.

**Segmented** facilities by bed size, revealing that larger facilities (100+ beds) depend more heavily on contractors due to their staffing demands.

**Analyzed** seasonal patterns to detect peaks in contractor usage during Q1 and Q4, likely linked to flu outbreaks and holiday staffing shortages.

## Key Insights:
Government-owned nursing homes have the highest contractor utilization rate (12.77%).

States with high contractor demand represent key markets for Clipboard Health.

Larger facilities (100+ beds) should be prioritized for targeted sales efforts.
