## GOAL: Uncover contractor utilization trends in U.S. nursing homes to optimize sales strategies.

## Actions Taken:

**Merged two large datasets:**
1,048,575 rows of daily staffing data from Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ).
14,512 rows of nursing home provider data.

**Calculated** contractor utilization percentages for each nursing home, identifying the top 10 facilities with the highest contractor reliance.
**Performed** geographic analysis to highlight states with the highest contractor utilization, including Maine, New York, and Delaware.
**Segmented** facilities by bed size, revealing that larger facilities (100+ beds) depend more heavily on contractors due to their staffing demands.
**Analyzed** seasonal patterns to detect peaks in contractor usage during Q1 and Q4, likely linked to flu outbreaks and holiday staffing shortages.

## Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL Server, MS Excel (Pivot Tables, Power Query).

## Key Insights:
Government-owned nursing homes have the highest contractor utilization rate (12.77%).
States with high contractor demand represent key markets for Clipboard Health.
Larger facilities (100+ beds) should be prioritized for targeted sales efforts.
